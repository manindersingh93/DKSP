# Knowledge Sharing Platform

## Vision

The Knowledge Sharing Platform is a decentralized application designed to facilitate the sale and purchase of digital content using blockchain technology. By leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, this platform ensures transparency, security, and direct transactions between content creators and consumers. The goal is to create an accessible and trustless environment where users can monetize their content and buyers can acquire valuable knowledge with confidence.

## Features

- **Add Content**: Content creators can upload and list their digital content with a title, description, and a unique content hash (e.g., IPFS hash). The content is priced, and users can purchase it directly.
- **Purchase Content**: Buyers can purchase content by sending Ether directly to the content creator. Each purchase is recorded, and content access is granted to the buyer.
- **Content Retrieval**: Users can retrieve detailed information about any content listed on the platform.
- **Purchase Tracking**: The system tracks which users have purchased which content to prevent duplicate purchases.
